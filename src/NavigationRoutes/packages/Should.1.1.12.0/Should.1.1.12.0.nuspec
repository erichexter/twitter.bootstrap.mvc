    <description>The Should Assertion Library provides a set of extension methods for test assertions for AAA and BDD style tests. It provides assertions only, and as a result it is Test runner agnostic. The assertions are a direct fork of the xUnit test assertions. This project was born because test runners Should be independent of the the assertions!</description>
